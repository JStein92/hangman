 - Need a preset list of words that computer can select from randomly
 - Need a form for user to guess - enter the character they guess into a list of Guesses.
 - Computer compared letters in the word to the guess Char the user entered
 - keep track of x/6 guesses, with messages
 - loop through each Char in the word, and if Guess Char matches, it shows world Char
 - display incorrect guess Chars in seperate div
